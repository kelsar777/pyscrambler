#pyscramber
This is a tool for creaitng scrambles of rubik's cubes - 2x2 or 3x3 and for training given solving algorithms.


How to use?
We need run scrambler.py:
$   python scrambler.py 
and next we set number of scrambles in this session and level of each scramble (number of scrambling moves).

When we run whith parameter "list":
$   python scrambler.py list 
we get all list of scrambles at one time.


When we have ./collections subfolder, we can run with parameter:
$   python scrambler.py c

and next choose an arbitraty saved collection of algorithms to train, for exmple cube 3x3 PLL permutations.
